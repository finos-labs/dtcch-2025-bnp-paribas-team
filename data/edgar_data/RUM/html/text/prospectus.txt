8,050,000 Shares of Class A Common Stock Underlying Warrants333,568,989 Shares of Class A Common Stock by the Selling Holders550,000 Warrants to Purchase Class A Common Stock by the Selling Holders
This prospectus relates to (a) the issuance by us of up to 8,050,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), upon the exercise of warrants, each exercisable for one share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share (“Warrants”) and (b) the resale from time to time by the selling securityholders named in this prospectus (each a “Selling Holder” and collectively, the “Selling Holders”) of (i) up to 333,568,989 shares of Class A Common Stock, consisting of 333,018,989 shares of Class A Common Stock and 550,000 shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of Warrants and (ii) 550,000 Warrants. With respect to the 333,568,989 shares of Class A Common Stock held by the Selling Holders, we are registering the resale of (i) 8,300,000 shares of Class A Common Stock that were issued on a private placement basis at a price of $10.00 per share in the PIPE Investment in connection with our Business Combination pursuant to customary registration rights that we granted to our PIPE Investors, (ii) 227,891,189 shares of Class A Common Stock that were previously registered on Form S-4 in connection with our Business Combination (as well as the resale of 86,752,800 shares underlying options to be registered on Form S-8) pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement (as further described herein), which provides for, among other things, customary resale underwritten demand and related “piggyback rights” for certain Selling Holders and which shares of Class A Common Stock (including those shares of Class A Common Stock underlying options) were received by existing shareholders of Rumble Canada (as defined below) in exchange for their securities in Rumble Canada as part of the consummation of the Business Combination, (iii) 10,075,000 shares of Class A Common Stock held by the Sponsor and its related parties pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement and/or certain registration rights granted in connection with CF VI’s initial public offering, which are comprised of (A) 1,875,000 shares of Class A Common Stock issued to the Sponsor pursuant to the Forward Purchase Contract at an effective price of $8.00 per share, (B) 7,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock issued to the Sponsor and former independent directors of CF VI in exchange for the 7,500,000 shares of Class B Common Stock issued to them in connection with the formation of CF VI at a price of $0.003 per share, and (C) 700,000 shares of Class A Common Stock issued to the Sponsor in connection with a private placement at a price of $10.00 per share, and (iv) 550,000 shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of Warrants at an exercise price of $11.50 per Warrant.
As described above, the Selling Holders acquired the shares of Class A Common Stock covered by this prospectus at prices ranging from $0.003 per share to $10.00 per share of Class A Common Stock. By comparison, the offering price to public shareholders in the CF VI initial public offering was $10.00 per unit, which consisted of one share and one-fourth of one Warrant. Consequently, certain Selling Holders may realize a positive rate of return on the sale of their shares covered by this prospectus even if the market price per share of Class A Common Stock is below $10.00 per share, in which case the public shareholders may experience a negative rate of return on their investment. For example, a Selling Holder who sells 1,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (which it originally acquired as “founder shares” for $0.003 per share) at a price per share of $12.27 per share (the closing price of the Class A Common Stock on November 3, 2022) will earn a realized profit of $12,267,000, while a public stockholder who sells the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock (which it originally acquired for $10.00 per share in the initial public offering) will only earn a realized profit of $2,270,000.
Certain Selling Holders, including Rumble Chairman and CEO Christopher Pavlovski and other company insiders, are subject to contractual lock-up restrictions that prohibit them from selling stock at this time. The shares of Class A Common Stock held by the Sponsor (other than the 1,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock constituting the Forward Purchase Shares and the 1,159,000 shares of Class A Common Stock that were acquired 

 
Table of Contents

by the Sponsor in the PIPE Investment) are also subject to contractual lock-up restrictions. See the section entitled “Plan of Distribution.” However, because the current market price of our Class A Common Stock, which was $12.27 per share at the closing on November 3, 2022, is higher than the price the Selling Holders paid for their shares of Class A Common Stock (ranging from $0.003 per share to $10.00 per share) or the exercise price of the Warrants ($11.50 per share), there is more likelihood that Selling Holders holding shares of Class A Common Stock or Warrants will sell their shares of Class A Common Stock after the registration statement that includes this prospectus is declared effective (subject, in the case of certain Selling Holders, to compliance with the contractual lock-up restrictions referred to above). Such sales, or the prospect of such sales, may have a material negative impact on the market price of our Class A Common Stock. After the effectiveness of the registration statement that includes this prospectus, (i) 25,447,437 shares of Class A Common Stock registered on the registration statement that includes this prospectus and that were purchased by Selling Holders for prices below current market prices will be able to be sold immediately pursuant to such registration statement without any contractual lock-up restrictions and (ii) an additional 315,621,552 shares of Class A Common Stock registered on the registration statement that includes this prospectus and that were purchased by Selling Holders for prices below current market prices will be able to be sold pursuant to such registration statement once the contractual lock-up restrictions that apply to such Selling Holders expire. It should be noted that the share numbers in the immediately preceding sentence are given on a fully diluted basis (inclusive of all shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exchange of ExchangeCo Shares, and which also includes shares of Class A Common Stock and ExchangeCo Shares placed in escrow pursuant to the terms of the BCA).
This prospectus provides you with a general description of such securities and the general manner in which the Selling Holders may offer or sell the securities. More specific terms of any securities that the Selling Holders may offer or sell may be provided in a prospectus supplement that describes, among other things, the specific amounts and prices of the securities being offered and the terms of the offering. The prospectus supplement may also add, update or change information contained in this prospectus.
On September 16, 2022, we consummated the business combination (the “Business Combination”) contemplated by that certain Business Combination Agreement, dated as of December 1, 2021 (as amended, the “BCA”), by and between CF Acquisition Corp. VI, a Delaware corporation (“CF VI”), and Rumble Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada (“Rumble Canada”). In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, CF VI changed its name from CF Acquisition Corp. VI to Rumble Inc. and Rumble Canada changed its name from Rumble Inc. to Rumble Canada Inc.
We will bear all costs, expenses and fees in connection with the registration of the securities offered pursuant to this prospectus and will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the securities offered pursuant to this prospectus. The Selling Holders will bear all commissions and discounts, if any, attributable to their sales of the securities offered pursuant to this prospectus.
You should read this prospectus and any prospectus supplement or amendment carefully before you invest in our securities. Our Class A Common Stock and Warrants are listed on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbols “RUM” and “RUMBW”, respectively. On November 3, 2022, the closing sale prices of our Class A Common Stock and Warrants were $12.27 and $2.63, respectively. We are an “emerging growth company” as defined under the U.S. federal securities laws and, as such, may elect to comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements for this and future filings.
Investing in our Class A Common Stock and Warrants involves a high degree of risk. See the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 9 of this prospectus.
Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.
The date of this prospectus is November 14, 2022.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the securities offered pursuant to this prospectus, except with respect to amounts received by us upon exercise of the Warrants offered hereby (to the extent such Warrants are exercised for cash).
Neither we nor the Selling Holders (as defined below) have authorized anyone to provide you with any information or to make any representations other than those contained in this prospectus or any applicable prospectus supplement or any free writing prospectuses prepared by or on behalf of us or to which we have referred you.

On September 16, 2022, we consummated the business combination (the “Business Combination”) contemplated by that certain Business Combination Agreement, dated as of December 1, 2021 (as amended, the “BCA”), by and between CF Acquisition Corp. VI, a Delaware corporation (“CF VI”), and Rumble Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada (“Rumble Canada”).

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This prospectus contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our plans, strategies and prospects, both business and financial. These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Although we believe that our plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve or realize these plans, intentions or expectations. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events or results of operations, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipates,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predicts,” “project,” “should,” “would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Investors should read statements that contain these words carefully because they:
•        discuss future expectations;
•        contain projects of future results of operations or financial condition; or
•        state other “forward-looking” information.
We believe it is important to communicate our expectations to our securityholders. However, there may be events in the future that management is not able to predict accurately or over which we have no control. The risk factors and cautionary language contained in this prospectus provide examples of risks, uncertainties, and events that may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in such forward-looking statements, including among other things:
•        Rumble’s ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination, which may be affected by, among other things, the ability of Rumble to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with customers, compete within its industry and retain its key employees;
•        the possibility that Rumble may be adversely impacted by economic, business, and/or competitive factors;
•        Rumble’s limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate its business and prospects;
•        Rumble’s recent and rapid growth may not be indicative of future performance;
•        Rumble may not continue to grow or maintain its active user base, and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability;
•        Rumble collects, stores, and processes large amounts of user video content and personal information of its users and subscribers. If Rumble’s security measures are breached, its sites and applications may be perceived as not being secure, traffic and advertisers may curtail or stop viewing its content or using its services, its business and operating results could be harmed, and it could face legal claims from users and subscribers;
•        Rumble may fail to comply with applicable privacy laws;
•        Rumble is subject to cybersecurity risks and interruptions or failures in Rumble’s information technology systems and as it grows and gains recognition, it will likely need to expend additional resources to enhance Rumble’s protection from such risks. Notwithstanding Rumble’s efforts, a cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss;
•        Rumble may be found to have infringed on the intellectual property of others, which could expose Rumble to substantial losses or restrict its operations;
•        Rumble may face liability for hosting a variety of tortious or unlawful materials uploaded by third parties, notwithstanding the liability protections of section 230 of the Communications Decency Act;
•        Rumble may face negative publicity for removing, or declining to remove, certain content, regardless of whether such content violated any law;

iii
Table of Contents

•        Rumble’s traffic growth, engagement, and monetization depend upon effective operation within and compatibility with operating systems, networks, devices, web browsers and standards, including mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that it does not control;
•        Rumble’s business depends on continued and unimpeded access to its content and services on the Internet. If Rumble or those who engage with its content experience disruptions in Internet service, or if Internet service providers are able to block, degrade or charge for access to Rumble’s content and services, Rumble could incur additional expenses and the loss of traffic and advertisers;
•        Rumble faces significant market competition, and if Rumble is unable to compete effectively with its competitors for traffic and advertising spend, its business and operating results could be harmed;
•        changes to Rumble’s existing content and services could fail to attract traffic and advertisers or fail to generate revenue;
•        Rumble depends on third-party vendors, including Internet service providers, advertising networks, and data centers, to provide core services;
•        hosting and delivery costs may increase unexpectedly;
•        we have offered and intend to continue to offer incentives, including economic incentives, to content creators to join our platform, and these arrangements often involve fixed payment obligations that are not contingent on actual revenue or performance metrics generated by the applicable content creator but rather are typically based on our modeled financial projections for that creator, which if not satisfied may adversely impact our financial performance, results of operations and liquidity;
•        changes in tax rates, changes in tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact Rumble’s financial results;
•        compliance obligations imposed by new privacy laws, laws regulating social media platforms and online speech in the U.S. and Canada, or industry practices may adversely affect Rumble’s business;
•        the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis that has caused significant economic and social disruption, and its impact on Rumble’s business is uncertain; and
•        other risks and uncertainties indicated in this prospectus, including those under “Risk Factors” herein, and other filings that have been made or will be made with the SEC by Rumble.
Forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this prospectus and involve a number of judgments and assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside the control of Rumble and its management team. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Rumble’s views as of any subsequent date. Rumble does not undertake any obligation to update, add or to otherwise correct any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events, inaccuracies that become apparent after the date hereof or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.
Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that the occurrence of one or more of the events described in the “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this prospectus may adversely affect us.

SUMMARY OF THE PROSPECTUS
This summary highlights selected information from this prospectus and may not contain all of the information that is important to you in making an investment decision.

Company Overview
Unless the section herein specifies otherwise, references to the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” are to, (a) prior to the closing of the Business Combination, either (i) CF VI or (ii) Rumble Canada, as the context may require, and (b) following the closing of the Business Combination, Rumble Inc., a Delaware corporation. Unless the section herein specifies otherwise, references to “Rumble” are to (x) prior to the closing of the Business Combination, Rumble Canada and (y) following the closing of the Business Combination, Rumble Inc., a Delaware corporation.
Our Story
Rumble is a high-growth video sharing platform designed to help content creators manage, distribute, and monetize their content by connecting them with brands, publishers, and directly to their subscribers and followers. In the third quarter of 2020, we welcomed Devin Nunes, former U.S. Representative for California, and Dan Bongino, political commentator, to our platform. These additions, along with tailwinds from the U.S. election season, led to dramatic growth in our user base from 1.2 million monthly active users (“MAUs”) in Q2 2020 to 21 million MAUs in Q4 2020.1
Over the course of 2021 and into 2022, we have continued to strengthen our content offering with increasing adoption from top creators, such as Jorge Masvidal, Dr. Drew, Glenn Greenwald, finance analyst Matt Kohrs, and Russell Brand. In 2022, we added significant creators outside of North America, starting with “Monark,” a creator described by the New York Times as “Brazil’s Joe Rogan.” As a result, our user base has grown to 44 million MAUs on average in Q2 2022, an increase of 76% from Q2 2021. We have also made significant strides in scaling our business and our opportunity through the acquisition of Locals.com, a premier subscription-based service for multimedia content and community, in October 2021.
For the past year and for the immediate future our focus has been and will continue to be growing users and usage consumption, and not maximizing revenue. We will continue to focus on growing consumption by enhancing the user experience across all access modes, pursuing international growth, and expanding our content volume and variety. In the future, we expect to monetize this consumption by increasing ad load and increasing ad pricing by building our own ad ecosystem rather than today’s programmatic exchanges. Monetization has the potential to be further enhanced as we continue to expand into additional creator services that bring more value and earnings to our creators, such as subscriptions via Locals, tipping and licensing. Lastly, we also expect to drive revenue by offering Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (“IaaS”) via our spare capacity in order to meet the unsolicited demand for cloud services many small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”) have requested of us.
Our Growth Strategy
•        Grow our platform’s consumption — Growth in our user base and user engagement is an important driver to our business’s growth, and we believe that there is a significant opportunity to expand user consumption on our platform. Since our inception, our user base has primarily grown organically.
•        Content acquisition — Our user base and user engagement growth are directly driven by the content available on our platform. We have on-boarded a number of top content creators onto our platform over the last year which has enabled our significant consumption growth. Our goal is to attract even more top creators to our platform, further accelerating our platform’s growth, and we have offered and intend to continue to offer incentives, including economic incentives, to content creators to join our platform. These incentives have included and may continue to include equity grants or cash payments, including 
____________1        Operating metrics presented do not include Locals.com, which was acquired in October 2021.

Table of Contents

arrangements under which we may agree to pay fixed compensation to content creators (in certain cases, for multiple years) irrespective of whether the actual revenue or user growth generated by the content creator on our platform meets our original modeled financial projections for that creator.
•        Product development — We plan to continue to build new features and technologies to develop and improve our platform and value proposition. We are currently working on implementing and upgrading livestreaming, mobile application camera integration, gifting and tipping functionality, user interface enhancements, and deep linking into our products.
•        Mobile application — We expect mobile application (“app”) users will be a key component of our user base and engagement in the future. An improved user interface and user experience will serve our existing app users, attract new app users to our platform, and grow app engagement.
•        International expansion — Historically, we have focused on growing our U.S. and Canadian user base; any historic consumption from international countries has been purely opportunistic. Moving forward, we expect to focus on growing our international user base. The recent addition of “Monark,” a prominent Brazilian podcast host, marks Rumble’s first significant expansion outside of North America.
•        Build in-house advertising ecosystem — Historically, we have used several third party ad networks and ad exchanges to fill our ad inventory. By developing our own advertising marketplace and direct ad sales team, we can reduce value leakage to exchanges, expand our advertiser base and drive better monetization. We introduced the alpha version of this marketplace in January 2022, and eventually all ads on Rumble’s platform will be served through Rumble’s own advertising system.
•        Expand Locals subscription and tipping service — Locals.com’s platform allows us to provide content creators additional revenue streams besides advertising revenue share, thereby expanding our creator value proposition and monetization opportunities.
•        Develop enterprise cloud IaaS opportunity — Our consumer business is supported by a network of in-house infrastructure which we plan on leveraging to offer an enterprise cloud solution to SMEs. We expect that our solution will include video streaming, email services, storage and cloud & website hosting and is expected to be cost-competitive to incumbent cloud players.
Marketing and Advertising
•        Users & Creators — With the tremendous amount of organic growth experienced to date, most of our marketing efforts have been focused on amplifying earned media and accelerating the word-of-mouth momentum through creator advocacy. As a result, we have been able to build our user base and brand with relatively minimal marketing costs. In the future, we will look to drive user growth and video consumption through (1) content creator partnerships and advocacy, including by offering incentives, including economic incentives, to content creators to join our platform, (2) continued earned media strategies, and (3) increased marketing spend, primarily through digital paid media channels.
•        Advertisers — We currently use several third party ad networks and ad exchanges to fill our ad inventory. By developing our own ad network, we will be in position to drive our value proposition and expand our advertiser base. In January 2022, we announced the deployment of an alpha version of our own advertising marketplace. Several advertisers have begun to run campaigns through the new system, and eventually, all ads on the Rumble platform will be served through its own advertising system. As we scale our platform, we expect to eventually drive significant and differentiated value to advertisers through the development of this independent advertising marketplace.
•        Enterprise — As we look to expand into the IaaS space and offer Cloud Solutions to the enterprise segment, we plan to build out our business-to-business subscription-based marketing -model. We expect that these services will include video streaming, email services, storage and cloud & website hosting.
Human Capital
As a software technology company, we believe our employees are our number one resource. As of June 30, 2022, we had 50 full-time employees, of whom 18 were based in Canada and 32 were based in the U.S. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Overall, we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

Our Company Culture
First and foremost, we hire those who are united in our mission to protect a free and open Internet. Like the creators we exist to serve, our Rumble team is full of people who like to think, to question, to build, to listen, and who want to do work that will change the world. As a team, we are:
•        Focused on our mission
•        Free in our expression
•        Fast in our execution
•        Fearless in our pursuit
The collective passion in our mission is uniquely powerful. We see this passion shared every day not only by our employees, but by our users, creators, and our customers. It is this passion and our approach to business which we believe will continue to differentiate Rumble from our competition.
Competition
We compete in almost every aspect of our business with companies (many of which are much larger and more well capitalized than us) that also provide video streaming platforms to content creators, including YouTube, Roku, TikTok, Snapchat and Facebook. We compete with these companies to attract, engage and retain users and subscribers.
Government Regulation
We are subject to domestic and foreign laws that affect companies conducting business on the Internet generally, including laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for their operations and the activities of their users.
Because we host user-uploaded content, we may be subject to laws concerning such content. In the U.S., we rely, to a significant degree, on laws that limit the liability of online providers for user-uploaded content, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA) and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Countries outside the U.S. generally do not provide as robust protections for online providers and may instead regulate such entities to a higher degree. For example, in certain countries, online providers may be liable for hosting certain types of content or may be required to remove such content within a short period of time upon notice. We or our customers may also be subject to laws that regulate streaming services or online platforms, such as the EU’s Audiovisual Media Services Directive or EU Regulation 2019/1150, which regulates platform-to-business relations.
Because we receive, store and use a substantial amount of information received from or generated by our users, we are also impacted by laws and regulations governing privacy and data security in the U.S. and worldwide. Examples of such regimes include Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). These laws generally regulate the collection, storage, transfer and use of personal information.
Because our platform facilitates online payments, including subscription fees and tipping, we are subject to a variety of laws governing online transactions, payment card transactions and the automatic renewal of online agreements. In the U.S., these matters are regulated by, among other things, the federal Restore Online Shoppers Confidence Act (ROSCA) and various state laws.
As a U.S.-based company with Canadian operations, we are subject to a variety of foreign laws governing our foreign operations, as well as Canadian and U.S. laws that restrict trade and certain practices.
Product Development
With relatively limited access to capital for most of the company’s history, our product and engineering teams have worked in an environment based on efficiency and speed with a stringent focus on end-user value. With new access to capital upon consummation of the Business Combination and the ability to scale, it will be critical to maintain this culture as we look to bring new innovations to our users and creators.

Infrastructure
Guided by our overarching philosophy to technology, our business plan contemplates spending considerable resources and investment on the underlying infrastructure that supports our products, such as building out and networking multiple points of presence (PoPs) and optimizing at a scale of billions of minutes of video consumption on our platform every month to millions of users, which requires significant investments in IT equipment, servers, bandwidth and data centers and data hosting/storage. Rumble has made initial investments in the first half of 2022 and, as our business continues to grow and scale, we expect such investments to grow proportionately over time.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property includes trademarks, such as RUMBLE in the United States and Canada, pending international trademarks for RUMBLE, and a pending U.S. trademark application for LOCALS; the domain names rumble.com and locals.com; copyrights in our source code, website, apps and creative assets; and trade secrets. In addition, our platforms are powered by a proprietary technology platform. We rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, a combination of work for hire, assignment, and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, trade dress, domain name, copyright, and trade secret laws to protect our brands, proprietary technology, and other intellectual property rights. We intend to continue to file additional applications with respect to our intellectual property rights.
Acquisitions
In October 2021, we bolstered our value proposition for content creators by acquiring Locals Technology Inc., a solution for (1) creators looking to monetize their content through subscription, and (2) for users to gain access to premium content from their favorite content creators. The acquisition was designed to accelerate our subscription revenue model and brought approximately 86,000 subscribers to our platform. Prior to our acquisition of Locals, we did not offer a consumer-facing subscription service.
Facilities
We are headquartered in Longboat Key, Florida, and maintain offices in both the United States and Canada. A number of our U.S. employees work remotely. All of our facilities are leased. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our current needs. We intend to procure additional space in the future as we continue to add employees and expand geographically. We also believe that, if we require additional space, we will be able to lease additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of relief from certain reporting requirements and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:
•        presenting only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of selected financial data;
•        an exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
•        reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements in our periodic reports, proxy statements, and registration statements; and
•        exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.
In addition, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards, and therefore, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards at the same time as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies or those that have opted out of using such extended transition period, which may make comparison of our financial statements with such other public companies more difficult. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company or, with respect to adoption of certain new or revised accounting standards, until we irrevocably elect to opt out of using the extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of the CF VI initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced reporting burdens.
Controlled Company Exemption
Chris Pavlovski, our CEO and Chairman, owns 85% of our outstanding voting power for the election of directors. As a result, we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of applicable Nasdaq rules and, consequently, qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements. Please see the section entitled “Management — Controlled Company”.
Risk Factor Summary
Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section titled “Risk Factors,” that represent challenges that we face in connection with the successful implementation of our strategy and growth of our business. The occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in the section titled “Risk Factors,” alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination, and may have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Such risks include, but are not limited to:
•        we may not be able to recognize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination, which may be affected by, among other things, our ability to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with customers, compete within our industry and retain our key employees;
•        the possibility that we may be adversely impacted by economic, business, and/or competitive factors;
•        our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects;
•        our recent and rapid growth may not be indicative of future performance;

RISK FACTORS
An investment in the securities offered pursuant to this prospectus involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed above under “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” together with all of the other information included in this prospectus or any accompanying prospectus supplement, before making an investment decision. The occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in these risk factors, alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination, and may have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. We may face additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business or financial condition. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.
Risks Relating to Our Business
Rumble’s limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate its business and prospects.
We have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our businesses and prospects or forecast our future results. We are subject to the same risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets. Our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:
•        our ability to maintain and grow traffic, content uploads, and engagement;
•        changes made to social media and other platforms, or changes in the patterns of use of those channels by users;
•        our ability to attract and retain advertisers in a particular period;
•        the number of ads shown to our traffic;
•        the pricing of our advertising products;
•        the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond current advertising products;
•        the development and introduction of new content, products, or services by us or our competitors;
•        increases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive;
•        our reliance on key vendor relationships, including our relationship with Cosmic Inc. and Kosmik Development Skopje doo (“Cosmic”) to provide content moderation and software development services, and dependence on a small number of customer relationships;
•        legislation in Canada, the European Union, or other jurisdictions that forces us to change our content moderation policies and practices;
•        our ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins; and
•        system failures or breaches of security or privacy.
Rumble may not continue to grow or maintain its active user base, may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability and may not be able to scale its systems, technology, or infrastructure effectively or grow its business at the same or similar rate as other comparable companies.
While Rumble’s key performance metrics, including MAUs and minutes watched per month have grown in recent periods, this growth rate may not be sustainable and should not be considered indicative of future levels of active viewers and future performance. In addition, Rumble may not realize sufficient revenue to achieve or, if achieved, maintain profitability. As Rumble grows its business, Rumble’s revenue growth rates may slow in future periods due to a number of reasons, which may include slowing demand for its service, increasing competition, a

Table of Contents

decrease in the growth of its overall market, an inability to scale its systems, technology or infrastructure effectively, and its failure to capitalize on growth opportunities or the maturation of its business. Rumble may incur losses in the future for a number of reasons, including insufficient growth in the level of engagement, a failure to retain its existing level of engagement, increasing competition, the failure to continue to attract content creators with large followings, the payment of fixed payment obligations to content creators who join our platform that turn out to be unprofitable over the term of the applicable contract as a result of actual performance that does not meet our original modeled financial projections for that creator, as well as other risks described in these “Risk Factors,” and Rumble may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown factors. Rumble expects to continue to make investments in the development and expansion of its business, which may not result in increased or sufficient revenue or growth, including relative to other comparable companies, as a result of which Rumble may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.
If we fail to maintain adequate operational and financial resources, particularly if we continue to grow rapidly, we may be unable to execute our business plan or maintain high levels of service and customer satisfaction.
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, rapid growth, which has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. Our organizational structure is becoming more complex as we scale our operational, financial, and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures, and expand internationally. As we continue to grow, we face challenges of integrating, developing, training, and motivating a rapidly growing employee base in our various offices in multiple jurisdictions and navigating a complex multinational regulatory landscape. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth and change in a manner that preserves the functionality of our platforms and solutions, the quality of our products and services may suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to attract customers.
To manage growth in our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to grow and improve our operational, financial, and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. We will require significant capital expenditures and the allocation of valuable management resources to grow and change in these areas. Our expansion has placed, and our expected future growth will continue to place, a significant drain on our management, customer experience, research and development, sales and marketing, administrative, financial, and other resources.
We anticipate that significant additional investments will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our products and services, to expand into new geographic areas and to scale with our overall growth. If additional investments are required due to significant growth, this will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term.
Rumble collects, stores, and processes large amounts of user video content and personal information of its users and subscribers. If Rumble’s security measures are breached, its sites and applications may be perceived as not being secure, traffic and advertisers may curtail or stop viewing its content or using its services, its business and operating results could be harmed, and it could face legal claims from users and subscribers.
Rumble collects, stores, and processes large amounts of video content (including videos that are not intended for public consumption) and personal information of its users and subscribers. Rumble also shares such information, where appropriate, with third parties that help it operate its business. Despite Rumble’s efforts, it may fail to properly secure its systems and its user and subscriber data. This could be caused by technical issues (bugs), obsolete technology, human error or internal or external malfeasance, undiscovered vulnerabilities, and could lead to unauthorized disclosure of data, unauthorized changes or data losses. For example, Rumble routinely receives reports from security researchers regarding potential vulnerabilities in its applications. Rumble also relies on open-source software for various functions, which may contain undiscovered security flaws and create additional technical vulnerabilities. In addition, despite Rumble’s ongoing and additional investments in cybersecurity, such improvements and review may not identify abuses of Rumble’s platforms and misuse of user data. The existence of such vulnerabilities, if undetected or detected but not remediated, could result in unauthorized access to Rumble systems or the data of Rumble users.

Table of Contents

A data breach could expose Rumble to regulatory actions and litigation. Depending on the circumstances, Rumble may be required to disclose a suspected breach to regulators, affected individuals, and the public. This could lead to regulatory actions, including the possibility of fines, class action or traditional litigation by affected individuals, reputational harm, costly investigation and remedial efforts, the triggering of indemnification obligations under data-protection agreements with subscribers, vendors, and partners, higher premiums for cybersecurity insurance and other insurance policies, and the inability to obtain cybersecurity insurance or other forms of insurance. Given industry trends generally, we expect that the extension or renewal of cybersecurity insurance coverage beyond the current term will be difficult to obtain. The term of our existing cybersecurity coverage recently expired and, while we continue to pursue an extension, renewal or replacement thereof, we do not presently have cybersecurity insurance to compensate for any losses that may result from any breach of security. As a result, our results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to secure an extension, renewal or replacement of our cybersecurity coverage.
Rumble may fail to comply with applicable privacy laws.
We are subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage, use, processing, destruction, retention and security of personal information, including additional laws or regulations relating to health information. Rumble’s current privacy policies and practices, which are publicly available at rumble.com/s/privacy, are designed to comply with privacy and data protection laws in the United States and Canada. These policies and practices inform users how Rumble handles their personal information and, as permitted by law, allow users to change or delete the personal information in their user accounts. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve in jurisdictions worldwide, and these laws may at times be conflicting. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices, and our efforts to comply with the evolving data protection rules may be unsuccessful. We must devote significant resources to understanding and complying with this changing landscape. Failure to comply with federal, state, provincial and international laws regarding privacy and security of personal information could expose us to penalties under such laws, orders requiring that we change our practices, claims for damages or other liabilities, regulatory investigations and enforcement action (including fines and criminal prosecution of employees), litigation, significant costs for remediation, and damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Even if we have not violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Additionally, if we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of personal information, including protected health information, we could be found to have breached our contracts with certain third parties.
There are numerous U.S. and Canadian federal, state, and provincial laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information. Determining whether protected information has been handled in compliance with applicable privacy standards and our contractual obligations can be complex and may be subject to changing interpretation. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy laws, we could face civil and criminal penalties. Failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure can also constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce and be construed as a violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTCA”), 15 U.S.C. § 45(a). The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. In addition, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. We cannot be sure how these regulations will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations. In addition to the risks associated with enforcement activities and potential contractual liabilities, our ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations at the federal and state level may be costly and require ongoing modifications to our policies, procedures and systems.
Internationally, laws, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, transmission, storage, use, processing, destruction, retention and security of personal information. For example, in the European Union, the collection, transmission, storage, use, processing, destruction, retention and security of personal data is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) in addition to other applicable laws and regulations. The GDPR came into effect in May 2018, repealing and replacing the European Union Data Protection Directive, and imposing revised data privacy and security requirements on companies in relation to the 

11
Table of Contents

processing of personal data of European Union data subjects. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the European Union Member States governing the collection, transmission, storage, use, processing, destruction, retention and security of personal data, impose strict obligations with respect to, and restrictions on, the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Union that are not deemed to have protections for personal information, including the United States. The GDPR authorizes fines for certain violations of up to 4% of the total global annual turnover of the preceding financial year or €20 million, whichever is greater. Such fines are in addition to any civil litigation claims by data subjects. Separately, Brexit has led and could also lead to legislative and regulatory changes and may increase our compliance costs. As of January 1, 2021, and the expiry of transitional arrangements agreed to between the United Kingdom and the European Union, data processing in the United Kingdom is governed by a United Kingdom version of the GDPR (combining the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018), exposing us to two parallel regimes, each of which authorizes similar fines and other potentially divergent enforcement actions for certain violations. On June 28, 2021, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision for the United Kingdom, allowing for the relatively free exchange of personal information between the European Union and the United Kingdom. Other jurisdictions outside the European Union are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules and regulations, which could increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with noncompliance. We cannot guarantee that we are, or will be, in compliance with all applicable U.S., Canadian, or other international regulations as they are enforced now or as they evolve.
Rumble operates across many different markets both domestically and internationally which may subject it to cybersecurity, privacy, data security, data protection, and online content laws with uncertain interpretations, as well as impose conflicting obligations on Rumble.
International laws and regulations relating to cybersecurity, privacy, data security, data protection, and online content often are more restrictive than those in the United States. There is no harmonized approach to these laws and regulations globally. Consequently, as Rumble expands internationally from Canada and the United States, we increase our risk of non-compliance with applicable foreign data protection and online content laws, including laws that expose us to civil or criminal penalties in certain jurisdictions for our content moderation decisions. For example, in October 2022, the French government notified us of its belief that Rumble was in violation of EU regulations due to the hosting of content on the Rumble platform by certain users sanctioned in the EU. We believe the scope of the cited EU regulations is uncertain with respect to businesses like Rumble that do not have a permanent establishment in the EU and conduct their business exclusively outside of the EU. In response, we proactively decided to disable access to the Rumble platform for all users in France pending discussions with the French government and a legal challenge to the scope of the EU regulations. While this decision will not have a material effect on our business, as France represents less than one percent of our users, it is possible that similar circumstances in other jurisdictions may require us to disable access to our content to users in such jurisdictions, either temporarily or permanently, which may have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, various federal, state, provincial, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies, or self-regulatory organizations, may expand current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations or issue revised rules or guidance regarding cybersecurity, privacy, data security, data protection and online content. For example, Rumble may need to change and limit the way it uses personal information in operating its business and may have difficulty maintaining a single operating model that is compliant. In 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which, among other things, requires new disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new abilities to opt out of certain sales of information and may restrict the use of cookies and similar technologies for advertising purposes. The CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, was amended on multiple occasions and is the subject of regulations issued by the California Attorney General regarding certain aspects of the law and its application. Moreover, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) in November 2020. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA, creating obligations relating to consumer data beginning on January 1, 2022, with implementing regulations expected on or before July 1, 2022, and enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. Aspects of the CCPA and CPRA remain unclear, resulting in further uncertainty and potentially requiring us to modify our data practices and policies and to incur substantial additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Similar laws have been proposed, and likely will be proposed, in other states and at the federal level, and if passed, such laws may have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging. For example, on March 2, 2021, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“CDPA”) was signed into law. The CDPA becomes effective January 1, 2023 and contains provisions that, in addition to other mandates, require businesses subject to the legislation to conduct data protection assessments in certain circumstances and that require opt-in consent from Virginia consumers to process certain sensitive personal information.

Rumble is subject to cybersecurity risks and interruptions or failures in Rumble’s information technology systems and as it grows and gains recognition, it will likely need to expend additional resources to enhance Rumble’s protection from such risks. Notwithstanding Rumble’s efforts, a cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.
Rumble relies on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure to support its business. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks, are prevalent and have increased, including due to the possibility that the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine could result in increased cyber-attacks or cybersecurity incidents by state actors or others. Rumble’s technologies, systems and networks and those of its vendors, suppliers and other business partners may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance or vulnerabilities in widely used open source software, may remain undetected for an extended period. Rumble’s systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. Like most major social media platforms, Rumble is routinely targeted by cyberattacks that can result in interruptions to its services. Rumble expects these attacks will continue in the future. As the sophistication of cyber incidents continues to evolve, Rumble is and will likely continue to be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Additionally, any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, usage errors by employees, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other security breaches or similar events. The failure of any of Rumble’s information technology systems may cause disruptions in its operations, which could adversely affect its revenues and profitability, and lead to claims related to the disruption of our services from users of the Rumble platform, advertisers, and customers of Rumble’s cloud services.
Inadequate technical and legal intellectual property (IP) protections could prevent Rumble from defending or securing its proprietary technology and IP.
Our success is dependent, in part, upon protecting our proprietary information and technology. We may be unsuccessful in adequately protecting our intellectual property. No assurance can be given that confidentiality, non-disclosure, or invention assignment agreements with employees, consultants, or other parties will not be breached and will otherwise be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our platform or solutions, or certain aspects of our platform or solutions, and proprietary information. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our platform or solutions. Additionally, certain unauthorized use of our intellectual property may go undetected, or we may face legal or practical barriers to enforcing our legal rights even where unauthorized use is detected.
Current law may not provide for adequate protection of our platform or data. In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of proprietary rights in Internet-related businesses are uncertain and evolving, and changes in these standards may adversely impact the viability or value of our proprietary rights. Some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer, and disclosure of our platform, or certain aspects of our platform, or our data may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions. Further, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries may be inadequate. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our data or certain aspects of our platform, or our data may increase. Competitors, foreign governments, foreign government-backed actors, criminals, or other third parties may gain unauthorized access to our proprietary information and technology. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our technology and intellectual property.
To protect our intellectual property rights, we will be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights, and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by our customers or third parties. Litigation has been and may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Such litigation could be costly, time consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could delay further

sales or the implementation of our platform or solutions, impair the functionality of our platform or solutions, delay introductions of new features, integrations, and capabilities, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform or solutions, or injure our reputation. In addition, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new features, integrations, and capabilities, and we cannot be certain that we could license that technology on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and our inability to license this technology could harm our ability to compete.
Rumble may be found to have infringed on the IP of others, which could expose Rumble to substantial losses or restrict its operations.
We expect to be subject to legal claims that we have infringed the IP rights of others. To date, we have not fully evaluated the extent to which other parties may bring claims that our technology, including our use of open source software, infringes on the IP rights of others. The availability of damages and royalties and the potential for injunctive relief have increased the costs associated with litigating and settling patent infringement claims. Any claims, whether or not meritorious, could require us to spend significant time, money, and other resources in litigation, pay damages and royalties, develop new IP, modify, design around, or discontinue existing products, services, or features, or acquire licenses to the IP that is the subject of the infringement claims. These licenses, if required, may not be available at all or have acceptable terms. As a result, IP claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
Rumble may face liability for hosting content that allegedly infringes on third-party copyright laws.
If content providers do not have sufficient rights to the video content or other material that they upload or make available to Rumble, or if such video content or other material infringes or is alleged to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, Rumble could be subject to claims from those third parties, which could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. Although our content policies prohibit users from submitting infringing content to Rumble, and require users to indemnify Rumble for claims related to the violations of the rights of third parties arising from the submission of content to Rumble (including with respect to infringements of IP rights), Rumble does not verify that content providers own or have rights to all of the video content or other material that they upload or make available. As a result, Rumble may face potential liability for copyright or other intellectual property infringement, or other claims. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and have an adverse effect on Rumble’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Rumble can provide no assurance that it is adequately insured to cover claims related to user content or that its indemnification provisions will be adequate to mitigate all liability that may be imposed on it as a result of claims related to user content.
Rumble may face liability for hosting a variety of tortious or unlawful materials uploaded by third parties, notwithstanding the liability protections of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
In the United States, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act generally limits Rumble’s liability for hosting tortious and otherwise illegal content. The immunities conferred by Section 230 could be narrowed or eliminated through amendment, regulatory action or judicial interpretation. In 2018, Congress amended Section 230 to remove immunities for content that promotes or facilitates sex trafficking and prostitution. In 2020, various members of Congress introduced bills to further limit Section 230, and a petition was filed by a Department of Commerce entity with the Federal Communications Commission to commence a rulemaking to further limit Section 230.
Laws like Section 230 generally do not exist outside of the United States, and some countries have enacted laws that require online content providers to remove certain pieces of content within short time frames. For example, in 2020, France enacted a law requiring covered social media networks to remove terror content within one hour upon receiving notice. If Rumble fails to comply with such laws, it could be subject to prosecution or regulatory proceedings. In addition, some countries may decide to ban Rumble’s service based upon a single piece of content.
Rumble may also face liability when it removes content and accounts that it believes are violating its terms of service. While Rumble believes that Section 230 allows it to restrict or remove certain categories of content, its protections may not always end a lawsuit at an early stage, potentially resulting in costly and time-consuming litigation.

User-generated content could affect the quality of Rumble’s services and deter current or potential users from using its platforms, and Rumble may face negative publicity for removing, or declining to remove, certain content, regardless of whether such content violated any law.
Individuals and groups may upload controversial content to Rumble’s platform. Removing or failing to remove such content may result in negative publicity, which could harm its efforts to attract and retain users and subscribers. Rumble has also faced criticism from users and subscribers for removing content and terminating accounts in compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). Further, Rumble must continually manage and monitor its content and detect content that violates its terms of service. This content moderation service is provided by Cosmic, a key vendor, and we would experience a significant disruption if Cosmic were no longer able or willing to offer us that service. If a significant amount of content that violates its terms of service were not detected and removed by Rumble in a timely manner, or if a significant amount of information was perceived by users or the media to violate Rumble’s terms of service, whether or not such perceptions were accurate, Rumble’s brand, business and reputation could be harmed. This risk increases as the volume of content uploaded by users to Rumble continues to grow. In June 2022, Rumble announced the first phase of an updated content moderation process and released a new set of proposed content policies and removal and appeals process. While Rumble does not currently have a formalized removal and appeals process, the proposed policies are intended to reflect Rumble’s current practices and procedures and ensure a consistent and transparent process. Because the proposed policies are intended to formalize Rumble’s informal practices to date, Rumble does not anticipate that these changes (which are expected to be implemented by the end of 2022) will have a material impact on Rumble’s operations, although Rumble may need to hire personnel and incur additional costs to fully implement the final policies and procedures once adopted and there can be no assurance that the implementation of such policies and procedures will be effective or will be viewed favorably by Rumble’s content creators and other users. In the event Rumble’s content creators and other users do not agree with such policies and procedures or their implementation, such creators and other users could decrease their usage of Rumble (or cease using Rumble entirely), which could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations for any period. Additionally, there is a risk that users will upload content that predominantly represents certain political viewpoints, leading to public perceptions that Rumble endorses those viewpoints, regardless of whether or not such perceptions are accurate. There can be no guarantee that current or future negative publicity, complaints, allegations, political controversies, investigations or legal proceedings with respect to Rumble’s content, even if baseless, will not generate adverse publicity that could damage Rumble’s reputation. Any damage to Rumble’s reputation could harm its ability to attract and retain users and subscribers.
Users are increasingly using mobile devices and connected TV applications to access content within digital media and adjacent businesses, and if Rumble is unsuccessful in attracting new users to its mobile and connected TV offerings and expanding the capabilities of its content and other offerings with respect to its mobile and connected TV platforms, Rumble’s revenues could decline.
Rumble’s future success depends in part on the continued growth in the use of its mobile applications and platforms by its users. The use of mobile technology may not continue to grow at historical rates, users may not continue to use mobile technology to access digital media and adjacent businesses, and monetization rates for content on mobile devices and connected TV applications may be lower than monetization rates on traditional desktop platforms. Further, mobile devices may not be accepted as a viable long-term platform for a number of reasons, including actual or perceived lack of security of information and possible disruptions of service or connectivity. In addition, traffic on Rumble’s mobile platforms may not continue to grow if Rumble does not continue to innovate and introduce enhanced products on such platforms, or if users believe that Rumble’s competitors offer superior mobile products. The growth of traffic on Rumble’s mobile products may also slow or decline if its mobile applications are no longer compatible with operating systems such as iOS, Android, Windows or the devices they support. If use of Rumble’s mobile platforms does not continue to grow, Rumble’s business and operating results could be harmed.
Rumble’s traffic growth, engagement, and monetization depend upon effective operation within and compatibility with operating systems, networks, devices, web browsers and standards, including mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that it does not control.
We make our content available across a variety of operating systems and through websites. We are dependent on the compatibility of our content with popular devices, streaming tools, desktop and mobile operating systems, connected TV systems, web browsers that we do not control, such as Mac OS, Windows, Android, iOS, Chrome and Firefox, and mobile application stores, such as Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store. Any changes in such systems, devices or web browsers that degrade the functionality of our content or give preferential treatment to competitive content could adversely affect usage of our content.

A significant portion of our traffic accesses our content and services through mobile devices and, as a result, our ability to grow traffic, engagement and advertising revenue is increasingly dependent on our ability to generate revenue from content viewed and engaged with on mobile devices. A key element of our strategy is focusing on mobile applications (“apps”) and connected TV apps, and we expect to continue to devote significant resources to the creation and support of developing new and innovative mobile and connected TV products, services and apps. We are dependent on the interoperability of our content and our apps with popular mobile operating systems, streaming tools, networks and standards that we do not control, such as the Android and iOS operating systems. We also depend on the availability of the Rumble app on mobile application stores, such as Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store, and if our access to such stores is limited or terminated, regardless of the legitimacy of the stated reasons, our ability to reach users through our mobile app will be negatively impacted. We may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile and connected TV industries or in developing content that operates effectively with these technologies, systems, tools, networks, or standards. Any changes in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset and connected TV manufacturers, or mobile carriers, or in their terms of service or policies that reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute and monetize our content, impair access to our content by blocking access through mobile devices, make it hard to readily discover, install, update or access our content and apps on mobile devices and connected TVs, limit the effectiveness of advertisements, give preferential treatment to competitive, or their own, content or apps, limit our ability to measure the effectiveness of branded content, or charge fees related to the distribution of our content or apps could adversely affect the consumption and monetization of our content on mobile devices. Additionally, if the number of platforms for which we develop our product expands, it will result in an increase in our operating expenses. In the event that it is more difficult to access our content or use our apps and services, particularly on mobile devices and connected TVs, or if our users choose not to access our content or use our apps on their mobile devices and connected TVs or choose to use mobile products or connected TVs that do not offer access to our content or our apps, or if the preferences of our traffic require us to increase the number of platforms on which our product is made available to our traffic, our traffic growth, engagement, ad targeting and monetization could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
Rumble’s business depends on continued and unimpeded access to its content and services on the Internet. If Rumble or those who engage with its content experience disruptions in Internet service, or if Internet service providers are able to block, degrade or charge for access to Rumble’s content and services, Rumble could incur additional expenses and the loss of traffic and advertisers.
Our products and services depend on the ability of users to access our content and services on the Internet. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and Internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies and government-owned service providers. Laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet, including changes to laws or regulations impacting Internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for our products or offerings, increase our operating costs, require us to alter the manner in which we conduct our business and/or otherwise adversely affect our business. We could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business. For example, paid prioritization could enable Internet service providers, or ISPs, to impose higher fees and otherwise adversely impact our business. Internationally, government regulation concerning the Internet, and in particular, network neutrality, may be developing or may not exist at all. Within such an environment, without network neutrality regulations, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede both our and our customers’ domestic and international growth, increase our costs or adversely affect our business.
Rumble faces significant market competition, and if Rumble is unable to compete effectively with its competitors for traffic and advertising spend, its business and operating results could be harmed.
Competition for traffic and engagement with our content, products and services is intense. We compete against many companies to attract and engage traffic, including companies that have greater financial resources and larger user bases, and companies that offer a variety of Internet and mobile device-based content, products and services. As a result, our competitors may acquire and engage traffic at the expense of the growth or engagement of our traffic, which would negatively affect our business. We believe that our ability to compete effectively for traffic depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:
•        the popularity, usefulness and reliability of our content compared to that of our competitors;
•        the timing and market acceptance of our content;

16
Table of Contents

•        the continued expansion and adoption of our content;
•        our ability, and the ability of our competitors, to develop new content and enhancements to existing content;
•        our ability, and the ability of our competitors, to attract, develop and retain influencers and creative talent;
•        the frequency, relative prominence and appeal of the advertising displayed by us or our competitors;
•        public perceptions about the predominance of certain political viewpoints on our platform, regardless of whether those perceptions are accurate;
•        changes mandated by, or that we elect to make to address, legislation, regulatory constraints or litigation, including settlements and consent decrees, some of which may have a disproportionate impact on us;
•        our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees;
•        the costs of developing and procuring new content, relative to those of our competitors;
•        acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors; and
•        our reputation and brand strength relative to our competitors.
We also face significant competition for advertiser spend. We compete against online and mobile businesses and traditional media outlets, such as television, radio and print, for advertising budgets. In determining whether to buy advertising, our advertisers will consider the demand for our content, demographics of our traffic, advertising rates, results observed by advertisers, and alternative advertising options. The increasing number of digital media options available, through social networking tools and news aggregation websites, has expanded consumer choice significantly, resulting in traffic fragmentation and increased competition for advertising. In addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader content, product or service offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or services to gain additional share of advertising budgets. We will need to continue to innovate and improve the monetization capabilities of our websites and our mobile products in order to remain competitive. We believe that our ability to compete effectively for advertiser spend depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:
•        the size and composition of our user base relative to those of our competitors;
•        our ad targeting capabilities, and those of our competitors;
•        our ability, and the ability of our competitors, to adapt our respective models to the increasing power and significance of influencers to the advertising community;
•        the timing and market acceptance of our advertising content and advertising products, and those of our competitors;
•        our marketing and selling efforts, and those of our competitors;
•        public perceptions about the predominance of certain political viewpoints on our platform, regardless of whether those perceptions are accurate;
•        the pricing for our advertising products and services relative to those of our competitors;
•        the return our advertisers receive from our advertising products and services, and those of our competitors; and
•        our reputation and the strength of our brand relative to our competitors.
Changes to Rumble’s existing content and services could fail to attract traffic and advertisers or fail to generate revenue.
We may introduce significant changes to our existing content. The success of our new content depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. If this new content fails to engage traffic and advertisers, we may fail to generate sufficient revenue or operating profit to justify our investments,

and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, we have launched and expect to continue to launch strategic initiatives, which do not directly generate revenue but which we believe will enhance our attractiveness to traffic and advertisers. In the future, we may invest in new content, products, services, and initiatives to generate revenue, but there is no guarantee these approaches will be successful or that the costs associated with these efforts will not exceed the revenue generated. If our strategic initiatives do not enhance our ability to monetize our existing content or enable us to develop new approaches to monetization, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue or recover any associated development costs and our operating results could be adversely affected.
Rumble derives a substantial portion of its revenue from advertising and its relationships with a small number of key advertising networks and advertisers, the loss of which could materially harm its results of operations.
A substantial portion of Rumble’s revenue is generated from a small number of key advertising networks. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, approximately 45% and 50%, respectively, of Rumble’s total revenue derived from two advertising networks, Google AdSense and Decide (formerly known as LockerDome). As a user of Google AdSense, Rumble is subject to Google’s standard terms and conditions under the Google AdSense Online Terms of Service, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, which provide for (i) the creation by Rumble of an AdSense Account; (ii) a grant of permission by Rumble to Google to serve, as applicable, advertisements and other content, Google search boxes and search results and related search queries and other links to Rumble’s website; and (iii) the receipt of payment by Rumble, based solely on Google’s accounting, related to the number of valid clicks on ads displayed. As a user of Decide, Rumble is subject to Decide’s standard terms and conditions under its Partner Insertion Order, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, which incorporate the IAB/AAAA General Advertising Provisions, Version 3.0 and provide for applicable payment terms to Rumble based on ad usage. Google AdSense, Decide and other advertising partners, including publishers that are a part of Rumble’s advertising network and key sponsors of host-read advertisements, may not continue to do business with Rumble, or they may reduce the prices they are willing to pay to advertise with Rumble, if Rumble does not deliver ads in an effective manner, or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with Rumble will generate a competitive return relative to alternatives. If Rumble’s relationship with any third-party advertiser terminates for any reason, or if the commercial terms of its relationships are changed or do not continue to be renewed on favorable terms, Rumble would need to secure and integrate new advertising partners or develop its own advertising platform, which could negatively impact its revenues and profitability.
Rumble depends on third-party vendors, including Internet service providers and data centers, to provide core services.
Although we are building our own technical infrastructure, Rumble depends on third-party vendors, including Internet service providers and data centers to, among other things, provide customer support, develop software, host videos uploaded by its users, transcode videos (compressing a video file and converting it into a standard format optimized for streaming), stream videos to viewers, and process payments. These vendors provide certain critical services to Rumble’s technical infrastructure that are time-consuming and costly for Rumble to develop independently. Outages in those services would materially affect its video services and its ability to provide cloud services. Outages may expose Rumble to having to offer credits to subscribers, loss of subscribers, and reputational damage. Rumble is unlikely to be able to fully offset these losses with any credits it might receive from its vendors.
New technologies have been developed that are able to block certain online advertisements or impair Rumble’s ability to serve advertising, which could harm its operating results.
New technologies have been developed that could block or obscure the display of or targeting of Rumble’s content. For example, in June 2020, Apple announced plans to require applications using its mobile operating systems to obtain an end-user’s permission to track them or access their device’s advertising identifier for advertising and advertising measurement purposes, as well as other restrictions that could adversely affect Rumble’s ability to serve advertising, which could harm its operating results. Additionally, some providers of consumer mobile devices and web browsers have implemented, or announced plans to implement, means to make it easier for Internet users to prevent the placement of cookies or to block other tracking technologies, which could, if widely adopted, result in the use of third-party cookies and other methods of online tracking becoming significantly less effective and have a significant impact on our ability to monetize our user base.

Rumble’s future business activities in the cloud services space may revolve around a small number of key third-party service providers and a small number of customer relationships, the disruption of which could harm its operating results.
In order to build its cloud services offerings, Rumble has entered into agreements with certain third-party service providers. The success of Rumble’s future business activities in the cloud services space may depend upon such existing third-party providers, some of whom may compete with Rumble in other lines of business. If Rumble’s existing third-party service agreements terminate for any reason, or if the commercial terms of such agreements are changed or do not continue to be renewed on favorable terms, Rumble would need to enter into new third-party service agreements, which could negatively impact its revenues, ability to attract future cloud services customers, public reputation, and profitability.
In addition, Rumble’s initial cloud service offerings revolve around a small number of customer relationships, including our relationship with the Trump Media & Technology Group. If Rumble fails to deliver its product to the desired specifications of these initial customers, or if these initial customers terminate their cloud services agreements for any reason, future customers may doubt Rumble’s ability to offer cloud services, which would negatively impact the company’s revenues, public reputation, and profitability.
Rumble relies on its existing content providers, and on the recruiting of new content providers, and the loss of a material portion of its existing content providers, or its failure to recruit new providers, may materially harm its business and results of operations.
The loss of a material portion of Rumble’s existing content providers could result in material harm to Rumble’s business and results of operations. In the recent past, Rumble’s ability to recruit and maintain content providers may have been in part due to trends in American politics, where certain commentators have sought a neutral Internet platform. A change in such trends, including possible changes to existing platforms’ moderation policies that make those existing platforms more hospitable to a diverse range of viewpoints, could result in the loss of existing content providers or a failure to recruit new providers, which may materially harm Rumble’s business and results of operation. Additionally, as Rumble expands into international markets, we may fail to recruit new content providers in those markets, limiting the appeal of Rumble to international audiences.
Rumble has offered and intends to continue to offer incentives, including economic incentives, to content creators to join our platform, and these arrangements often involve fixed payment obligations that are not contingent on actual revenue or performance metrics generated by the applicable content creator but rather are typically based on our modeled financial projections for that creator, which if not satisfied may adversely impact our financial performance, results of operations and liquidity.
Our user base and user engagement growth are directly driven by the content available on our platform. We have on-boarded a number of top content creators onto our platform over the last year which has enabled our significant consumption growth. Our goal is to attract even more top creators to our platform, further accelerating our platform’s growth, and we have offered and intend to continue to offer incentives, including economic incentives, to content creators to join our platform. These incentives have included and may continue to include equity grants or cash payments, including arrangements under which we may agree to pay fixed compensation to a content creator (in certain cases, for multiple years) irrespective of whether the actual revenue or user growth generated by the applicable content creator on our platform meets our original modeled financial projections for that creator. To the extent our revenue and/or user growth assumptions associated with any such creator does not meet our expectations, our financial performance, results of operations and liquidity may be negative impacted, since the failure to achieve these expectations is not expected to reduce our fixed payment obligations to any such creator.
Rumble’s recent and rapid growth may not be indicative of future performance.
The growth Rumble experienced between late 2020 and early 2022 may be partly or largely attributable to increased demand for online video due to social distancing undertaken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If, when the COVID-19 pandemic ends, the level of demand for online video returns to pre-pandemic levels, then the growth rates Rumble achieved between late 2020 and early 2022 may not be indicative of growth rates in future periods. In addition, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues, a prolonged economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could ultimately reduce demand by reducing businesses’ ability to pay for Rumble’s services.

Rumble has made, and may in the future make, acquisitions, and such acquisitions could disrupt its operations, and may have an adverse effect on its operating results.
In order to expand our business, we have made acquisitions and may continue making similar acquisitions and possibly larger acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. The success of our future growth strategy will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate acquisitions and, if necessary, to obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing to fund those acquisitions. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and any acquisitions we complete may not be successful. Our past acquisitions and any mergers and acquisitions that we may undertake in the future involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to, the following:
•        difficulties in integrating and managing the operations, personnel, systems, technologies, and products of the companies we acquire;
•        diversion of our management’s attention from normal daily operations of our business;
•        our inability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of the businesses we acquire;
•        uncertainty of entry into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have stronger market positions;
•        our inability to increase revenue from an acquisition;
•        increased costs related to acquired operations and continuing support and development of acquired products;
•        our responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire;
•        potential goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and amortization associated with acquired businesses;
•        adverse tax consequences associated with acquisitions;
•        changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, including arrangements that we assume from an acquisition;
•        potential negative perceptions of our acquisitions by customers, financial markets or investors;
•        failure to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis, if at all, which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition;
•        our inability to apply and maintain our internal standards, controls, procedures and policies to acquired businesses;
•        potential loss of key employees of the companies we acquire;
•        potential security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate the product into our service offerings;
•        difficulties in increasing or maintaining security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services, and related costs;
•        ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company;
•        inadequate protection of acquired intellectual property rights; and
•        potential failure to achieve the expected benefits on a timely basis or at all.
Additionally, acquisitions or asset purchases made entirely or partially for cash may reduce our cash reserves or require us to incur additional debt under our credit agreements or otherwise. We may seek to obtain additional cash to fund an acquisition by selling equity or debt securities. We may be unable to secure the equity or debt funding necessary to finance future acquisitions on terms that are acceptable to us. If we finance acquisitions by 

20
Table of Contents

issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders will experience ownership dilution. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or substantially concurrent acquisitions.
Businesses that we acquire may have greater-than-expected liabilities for which we become responsible.
Businesses that we acquire may have liabilities or adverse operating issues, or both, that we fail to discover through due diligence or the extent of which we underestimate prior to the acquisition. For example, to the extent that any business that we acquire or any prior owners, employees, or agents of any acquired businesses or properties (i) failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws, rules, or regulations; (ii) failed to fulfill or disclose their obligations, contractual or otherwise, to applicable government authorities, their customers, suppliers, or others; or (iii) incurred tax or other liabilities, we, as the successor owner, may be financially responsible for these violations and failures and may suffer harm to our reputation and otherwise be adversely affected. An acquired business may have problems with internal control over financial reporting, which could be difficult for us to discover during our due diligence process and could in turn lead us to have significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our own internal control over financial reporting. These and any other costs, liabilities and disruptions associated with any of our past acquisitions and any future acquisitions could harm our operating results.
The loss of key personnel, or failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm Rumble’s business.
Our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain our senior officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. The loss of services of members of our senior management team and the uncertain transition of new members of our senior management team may strain our ability to execute our strategic initiatives, or make it more difficult to retain customers, attract or maintain our capital support, or meet other needs of our business. We may incur significant costs to attract and retain qualified personnel, and we may lose new employees to our competitors before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting them. If we fail to attract new personnel or if we suffer increases in costs or business operations interruptions as a result of a labor dispute, or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, we might not be able to operate our business effectively or efficiently, serve our customers properly or maintain the quality of our content and services. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies with respect to our employees.
Our management team has limited experience managing a public company.
Some members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company that is subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents will require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Rumble may be exposed to risk if it cannot enhance, maintain, and adhere to its internal controls and procedures.
As a public company, we will have significant requirements for enhanced financial reporting and internal controls. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company, and we are still in the process of generating a mature system of internal controls and integration across business systems. If we are unable to establish or maintain appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations on a timely basis, result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements, and harm our operating results.
Matters impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules, which may result in a breach of the covenants under existing or future financing arrangements. There also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor 

21
Table of Contents

confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm continue to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. This could materially adversely affect us and lead to a decline in the market price of Rumble’s common stock.
Changes in tax rates, changes in tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact Rumble’s financial results.
We are subject to taxes in other jurisdictions as well. Our provision for income taxes is based on a jurisdictional mix of earnings, statutory tax rates and enacted tax rules, including transfer pricing. There may also be tax costs associated with distributions from our subsidiaries in various jurisdictions.
Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. As a result, our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. These changes may adversely impact our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.
We are subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities and government bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax and other tax reserves. If our reserves are not sufficient to cover these contingencies, such inadequacy could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
In addition, due to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that various states or foreign countries might attempt to impose additional or new regulation on our business or levy additional or new sales, income or other taxes relating to our activities. Tax authorities at the international, federal, state and local levels are currently reviewing the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce. New or revised international, federal, state or local tax regulations or court decisions may subject us or our customers to additional sales, income and other taxes. For example, the European Union, certain member states, and other countries, as well as states within the United States, have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. The application of existing, new or revised taxes on our business, in particular, sales taxes, VAT and similar taxes would likely increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of selling products over the Internet. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
We are currently under or subject to examination for indirect taxes in various states, municipalities and foreign jurisdictions. Management currently believes we have adequate reserves established for these matters. If a material indirect tax liability associated with prior periods were to be recorded, for which there is not a reserve, it could materially affect our financial results for the period in which it is recorded.
Compliance obligations imposed by new privacy laws, laws regulating social media platforms and online speech in the U.S. and Canada, or industry practices may adversely affect Rumble’s business.
New laws could restrict Rumble’s ability to conduct marketing by, for example, restricting the emailing or targeting users or use certain technologies like artificial intelligence. Similarly, private-market participants may deploy technologies or require certain practices that limit Rumble’s ability to obtain or use certain information about its users and subscribers. For example, Google has indicated that it will ultimately phase out the use of cookies to track users of its search services in future versions of its Chrome web browser, and Apple has updated its iOS mobile operating system to require app developers to obtain opt-in consent before tracking users of its various services. If these types of changes are implemented (or as a result of their implementation), Rumble’s ability to determine how its users and subscribers are using its video services and to use targeted advertising in a cost-effective manner may be limited. New laws in Canada, the European Union, and other jurisdictions may also require us to change our content moderation practices, or privacy policies in ways that harm our business or create the risk of fines or other penalties for non-compliance.

Risks Related to Rumble and the Business Combination
Rumble is an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act and it has taken advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies; this could make Rumble’s securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare Rumble’s performance with other public companies.
Rumble is an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act and has taken advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. There can be no assurances whether investors will find Rumble’s securities less attractive because Rumble relies on these exemptions. If some investors find the securities less attractive as a result of reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of Rumble’s securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for Rumble’s securities and the trading prices of the securities may be more volatile.
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. Rumble has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, Rumble, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of its financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period, difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
Pursuant to the JOBS Act, Rumble’s independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for so long as it is an “emerging growth company”.
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, and generally requires in the same report a report by a public company’s independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. Rumble will continue to be required to provide management’s attestation on internal controls effective with respect to the year ended December 31, 2022, in accordance with applicable SEC guidance.
However, under the JOBS Act, Rumble’s independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 until it is no longer an “emerging growth company.” Rumble could be an “emerging growth company” until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following February 23, 2026, the fifth anniversary of CF VI’s IPO, (b) in which Rumble has total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (c) Rumble’s non-convertible debt issued within a three year period exceeds $1 billion, or (d) if the market value of Rumble’s shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of its second fiscal quarter.
Legal proceedings in connection with the Business Combination or otherwise, the outcomes of which are uncertain, could adversely impact Rumble or its stockholders.
In connection with business combination transactions similar to the Business Combination, it is not uncommon for lawsuits to be filed against the parties and/or their respective directors and officers alleging, among other things, that the proxy statement/prospectus provided to stockholders contains false and misleading statements and/or omits material information concerning the transaction. On January 27, 2022, Rumble received notification of a lawsuit filed by Kosmayer Investment Inc. (“KII”) against Rumble and Mr. Pavlovski in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, alleging fraudulent misrepresentation in connection with KII’s decision to redeem its shares of Rumble in August 2020. On June 3, 2022, Rumble served its statement of defence on KII. KII filed a reply pleading 

23
Table of Contents

on June 15, 2022. KII is seeking rescission of such redemption such that, following such rescission, KII would own 20% of the issued and outstanding Rumble Shares or, in the alternative, damages for the lost value of the redeemed shares, which KII has alleged to be worth $419.0 million (based on the value ascribed to the Rumble Shares in the Business Combination), together with other damages including punitive damages and costs. Although Rumble believes that the allegations are meritless and intends to vigorously defend against them, the result or impact of such claim, or any other claim that may be brought or threatened in connection with the Business Combination, is uncertain, and could result in, among other things, damages, and/or awards of attorneys’ fees or expenses.
The provision of the Rumble Charter that authorizes the Rumble Board to issue preferred stock from time to time based on terms approved by the Rumble Board may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that public stockholders might consider in their best interest.
The provision of Rumble’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Rumble Charter”) that authorizes the Rumble Board to issue preferred stock from time to time based on terms approved by the Rumble Board may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that you might consider in your best interest.
The Rumble Charter contains forum limitations for certain disputes between us and our stockholders that could limit the ability of stockholders to bring claims against us or our directors, officers and employees in jurisdictions preferred by stockholders.
The Rumble Charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative lawsuit brought on our behalf, (ii) any lawsuit against our current or former directors, officers, employees or stockholders asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any such person to us or our stockholders, (iii) any lawsuit asserting a claim arising under any provision of the DGCL, our charter or bylaws (each, as in effect from time to time), or (iv) any lawsuit governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware. The foregoing forum provisions do not apply to claims arising under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws for which there is exclusive federal or concurrent federal and state jurisdiction. The Rumble Charter also provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. The foregoing forum provisions may prevent or limit a stockholder’s ability to file a lawsuit in a judicial forum that it prefers for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders, which may discourage such lawsuits, make them more difficult or expensive to pursue, and result in outcomes that are less favorable to such stockholders than outcomes that may have been attainable in other jurisdictions, although though stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.
There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act because Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act claims.
In addition, notwithstanding the inclusion of the foregoing forum provisions in the Rumble Charter, courts may find the foregoing forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in certain cases that the foregoing forum provisions purport to address, including claims brought under the Securities Act. If this were to occur in any particular lawsuit, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such lawsuit in other jurisdictions or resolving lawsuits involving similar claims in multiple jurisdictions, all of which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
The CEO of Rumble will have control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of Rumble’s outstanding capital stock.
As the beneficial owner of all of the Class D Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Rumble (the “Class D Common Stock”), Chris Pavlovski, who is the CEO of Rumble, will initially be able to exercise voting rights with respect to 85% of the voting power of Rumble’s outstanding capital stock. For so long as Mr. Pavlovski continues to beneficially own at least approximately 8.47 million of the issued and outstanding shares of Class D Common Stock (assuming, for this purpose, that the number of outstanding shares of all classes of capital stock of Rumble continues to equal the same number of shares outstanding as of the closing of the Business Combination), 

24
Table of Contents

Mr. Pavlovski will continue to control the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders of Rumble for approval. Such number represents approximately 8.0% of the shares of Class D Common Stock that Mr. Pavlovski owns. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future. Further, the Rumble Charter will not include a sunset provision for the high vote feature of the Class D Common Stock, meaning this feature will persist indefinitely (unless amended or until all of the shares of Class D Common Stock have been redeemed by Rumble in connection with future transfers (other than “permitted transfers”) of shares of Class A Common Stock or ExchangeCo Shares by Mr. Pavlovski). As a result, Mr. Pavlovski may control or effectively control the voting of Rumble, even if he holds only a small economic interest. Consequently, in the event Mr. Pavlovski liquidates a significant portion of his economic interest in Rumble, Mr. Pavlovski may no longer be incentivized (or incentivized to the same extent) to exercise his voting control, including in connection with the types of decisions further described below, in a manner that will maximize the economic value of Rumble.
Because of the voting ratio between the Class D Common Stock on the one hand, and the Class A Common Stock and Class C Common Stock of Rumble, on the other hand, Mr. Pavlovski has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to Rumble’s stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments to Rumble’s organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of Rumble’s assets. The Rumble Charter provides that Rumble may not issue any shares of Class D Common Stock, so all of the Class D Common Stock are held by Mr. Pavlovski and/or his transferees. In this regard, no shares of Class D Common Stock may be transferred by Mr. Pavlovski unless the transfer is made to a qualified transferee as described in the Rumble Charter (a “Qualified Class D Transferee”). As a result, only Mr. Pavlovski has the right to vote and control the Class D Common Stock, meaning that Mr. Pavlovski is not entitled to transfer voting control of the Company to another person or entity not controlled by Mr. Pavlovski through the transfer of Class D Common Stock.
This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of Rumble’s assets that Rumble’s other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that Rumble’s other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring Rumble’s publicly traded Class A Common Stock, which will have limited voting power relative to the Class D Common Stock that is held by Mr. Pavlovski, and might harm the trading price of Rumble’s Class A Common Stock. In addition, Mr. Pavlovski has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of Rumble as a result of his position as Rumble’s CEO and his ability to control the election of Rumble’s directors. As a board member and officer, Mr. Pavlovski owes a fiduciary duty to Rumble’s stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of Rumble’s stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Pavlovski is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of Rumble’s stockholders generally.
Rumble’s CEO may be incentivized to focus on the short-term share price as a result of his interest in Forfeiture Escrow Shares.
Mr. Pavlovski, the CEO and controlling shareholder of Rumble, holds shares placed in escrow and subject to forfeiture pursuant to the terms of the BCA (collectively, “Forfeiture Escrow Shares”). Such shares will vest in the event certain share price thresholds are satisfied, but if such price thresholds are not satisfied in the applicable time periods, such shares will be forfeited and cancelled. Accordingly, Mr. Pavlovski may be incentivized to focus on short-term results which may have a positive effect on Rumble’s share price at the expense of the long-term success of the Company.
Rumble does not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.
Rumble does not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of its Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their shares after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.

Risks Related to Being a Public Company
Rumble has and will incur significant increased expenses and administrative burdens as a public company, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.
Rumble is facing significant increases in insurance, legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses as a public company that Rumble did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), including the requirements of Section 404, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and the securities exchanges, impose additional reporting and other obligations on public companies.
Compliance with public company requirements has and will increase costs and make certain activities more time-consuming. A number of those requirements require Rumble to carry out activities Rumble had not done previously. In addition, additional expenses associated with SEC reporting requirements have and will be incurred. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified (for example, if the auditors identify a material weakness or significant deficiency in the internal control over financial reporting), Rumble could incur additional costs to rectify those issues, and the existence of those issues could adversely affect Rumble’s reputation or investor perceptions of it. Being a public company could make it more difficult or costly for Rumble to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and Rumble may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage with increased self-retention risk or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. Being a public company could also make it more difficult and expensive for Rumble to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on the Rumble Board, board committees or as executive officers. Furthermore, if Rumble is unable to satisfy its obligations as a public company, it could be subject to delisting of its Class A Common Stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.
The additional reporting and other obligations imposed by various rules and regulations applicable to public companies will increase legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of related legal, accounting and administrative activities. These increased costs require Rumble to divert a significant amount of money that could otherwise be used to expand the business and achieve strategic objectives. Advocacy efforts by shareholders and third-parties may also prompt additional changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase costs.
There can be no assurance that Rumble will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq.
If Nasdaq delists Rumble’s shares from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards and Rumble is not able to list such securities on another national securities exchange, the securities of Rumble could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, Rumble and its stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:
•        a limited availability of market quotations for Rumble’s securities;
•        reduced liquidity for Rumble’s securities;
•        a determination that the Class A Common Stock is a “penny stock,” which will require brokers trading the Class A Common Stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for shares of Class A Common Stock;
•        a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and
•        a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.

If securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about Rumble, its business, or its market, or if they change their recommendations regarding Rumble’s securities adversely, the price and trading volume of Rumble’s securities could decline.
The trading market for Rumble’s securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about Rumble, its business, market or competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on Rumble. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of Rumble, Rumble’s share price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover Rumble change their recommendation regarding Rumble’s shares of common stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about Rumble’s competitors, the price of Rumble’s shares of common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover Rumble were to cease coverage of Rumble or fail to regularly publish reports on it, Rumble could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause its share price or trading volume to decline.
Substantial future sales of our Class A Common Stock by the Selling Holders could cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline.
The securities registered pursuant to the registration statement that includes this prospectus represent approximately 90.9% of our total shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis (inclusive of all shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exchange of ExchangeCo Shares, and which also includes shares of Class A Common Stock and ExchangeCo Shares placed in escrow pursuant to the terms of the BCA). Certain Selling Holders, including Rumble Chairman and CEO Christopher Pavlovski and other company insiders, are subject to contractual lock-up restrictions that prohibit them from selling stock at this time. The shares of Class A Common Stock held by the Sponsor (other than the 1,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock constituting the Forward Purchase Shares and the 1,159,000 shares of Class A Common Stock that were acquired by the Sponsor in the PIPE Investment) are also subject to contractual lock-up restrictions. See the section entitled “Plan of Distribution.” 
For Selling Holders who are not subject to contractual lock-up restrictions, after the registration statement that includes this prospectus is effective and until such time that it is no longer effective, the resale of these securities will be permitted pursuant to such registration statement. The resale, or expected or potential resale, of a substantial number of our shares of Class A Common Stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price for our Class A Common Stock and make it more difficult for you to sell your shares of Class A Common Stock at such times and at such prices that you deem desirable. Furthermore, we expect that because there will be a large number of securities registered pursuant to the registration statement that includes this prospectus, Selling Holders will continue to offer the securities covered by such registration statement for a significant period of time, the precise duration of which cannot be predicted. Accordingly, the adverse market and price pressures resulting from an offering pursuant to the registration statement that includes this prospectus may continue for an extended period of time.
Further, the Selling Holders acquired their shares at prices ranging from $0.003 per share to $10.00 per share of Class A Common Stock. Therefore, certain of the Selling Holders may realize a positive rate of return on their investment even if the shares of Class A Common Stock are trading below $10.00 per share. If those Selling Holders decided to sell their shares to realize this return, it could have a material negative impact on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Additionally, certain Selling Holders who are subject to contractual lock-up restrictions may choose to sell their shares once those restrictions expire. See the section entitled “Plan of Distribution.” Such sales, or the prospect of such sales, may have a material negative impact on the market price of our Class A Common Stock.
The Selling Holders can earn a positive return on their investment, even if other shareholders experience a negative rate of return on their investment in the post-Business Combination company.
The Selling Holders acquired the shares of Class A Common Stock covered by this prospectus at prices ranging from $0.003 per share to $10.00 per share of Class A Common Stock. By comparison, the offering price to public shareholders in the CF VI initial public offering was $10.00 per unit, which consisted of one share and one-fourth of one Warrant. Consequently, certain Selling Holders may realize a positive rate of return on the sale of their shares covered by this prospectus even if the market price per share of Class A Common Stock is below $10.00 per share, in which case the public shareholders may experience a negative rate of return on their investment. 

27
Table of Contents

For example, a Selling Holder who sells 1,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (which it originally acquired as “founder shares” for $0.003 per share) at a price per share of $12.27 per share (the closing price of the Class A Common Stock on November 3, 2022) will earn a realized profit of $12,267,000, while a public stockholder who sells the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock (which it originally acquired for $10.00 per share in the initial public offering) will only earn a realized profit of $2,270,000. 
In addition, because the current market price of our Class A Common Stock, which was $12.27 per share at the closing on November 3, 2022, is higher than the price the Selling Holders paid for their shares of Class A Common Stock (ranging from $0.003 per share to $10.00 per share) or the exercise price of the Warrants ($11.50 per share), there is more likelihood that Selling Holders holding shares of Class A Common Stock or Warrants will sell their shares of Class A Common Stock after the registration statement that includes this prospectus is declared effective (subject, in the case of certain Selling Holders, to compliance with contractual lock-up restrictions). Such sales, or the prospect of such sales, may have a material negative impact on the market price of our Class A Common Stock. After the effectiveness of the registration statement that includes this prospectus, (i) 25,447,437 shares of Class A Common Stock registered on the registration statement that includes this prospectus and that were purchased by Selling Holders for prices below current market prices will be able to be sold immediately pursuant to such registration statement without any contractual lock-up restrictions and (ii) an additional 315,621,552 shares of Class A Common Stock registered on the registration statement that includes this prospectus and that were purchased by Selling Holders for prices below current market prices will be able to be sold pursuant to such registration statement once the contractual lock-up restrictions that apply to such Selling Holders expire. It should be noted that the share numbers in the immediately preceding sentence are given on a fully diluted basis (inclusive of all shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exchange of ExchangeCo Shares, and which also includes shares of Class A Common Stock and ExchangeCo Shares placed in escrow pursuant to the terms of the BCA).
For more details about the contractual lock-up restrictions applicable to certain Selling Holders as referred to above, see the section entitled “Plan of Distribution.”

USE OF PROCEEDS
All of the shares of Class A Common Stock and Warrants offered by the Selling Holders pursuant to this prospectus will be sold by the Selling Holders for their respective accounts.
We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the securities offered pursuant to this prospectus, except with respect to amounts received by us upon exercise of the Warrants offered hereby (to the extent such Warrants are exercised for cash). We intend to use any such proceeds for general corporate purposes, although we believe we can fund our operations with cash on hand.
The Selling Holders will pay any underwriting fees, discounts, selling commissions, stock transfer taxes and certain legal expenses incurred by such Selling Holders in disposing of their shares of Class A Common Stock and Warrants covered by this prospectus, and we will bear all other costs, fees and expenses incurred in effecting the registration of the shares of Class A Common Stock and Warrants covered by this prospectus, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, Nasdaq listing fees and fees and expenses of our counsel and our independent registered public accountants.

Description of the Transaction
CF VI and Rumble entered into the Business Combination Agreement dated December 1, 2021. On September 15, 2022, the Business Combination Agreement was approved and adopted by CF VI Stockholders and the transactions under the Business Combination Agreement were consummated on September 16, 2022, resulting in Rumble becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of CF VI. In the consummation of the Business Combination, CF VI was renamed “Rumble, Inc.” and is referred to as the “Combined Entity” as of the time following such change of name. Under the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, upon the closing of the Business Combination, among other things:
•        for each Rumble Share held by the Electing Shareholders, such Electing Shareholder received a number of ExchangeCo Shares equal to the Rumble Exchange Ratio, and such Electing Shareholders concurrently subscribed for nominal value for a corresponding number of shares of Class C Common Stock; and
•        for each Rumble Share held by the Non-Electing Shareholders, such Non-Electing Shareholder received a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the Rumble Exchange Ratio.

Table of Contents

In addition, under the Business Combination Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement:
•        all outstanding options to purchase Rumble Shares were exchanged for the Exchanged Rumble Options; and
•        the outstanding warrant to purchase Rumble Shares was exchanged for a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of the number of shares of Rumble capital stock subject to the warrant and the Rumble Exchange Ratio.
In addition, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.0 million, upon the Closing and pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into between Mr. Pavlovski and CF VI, the Combined Entity issued and sold to Mr. Pavlovski a fixed number of shares of Class D Common Stock having 11.2663 “super-voting” rights per share, such that, after taking into account the shares of Class A Common Stock and Class C Common Stock issued to Mr. Pavlovski at Closing, upon Closing, Mr. Pavlovski has 85% of the voting power of the Combined Entity on a fully-diluted basis. Such shares of Class D Common Stock to be issued to Mr. Pavlovski will be the only issued and outstanding shares of Class D Common Stock.
On October 25, 2021, Rumble and Locals entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, which closed concurrently with execution and pursuant to which each share of Locals Common Stock and Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time was cancelled, extinguished and converted automatically into the right to receive a number of Rumble Class A Common Shares and Rumble Class B Common Shares. In addition, each Locals option outstanding prior to the effective time was cancelled and substituted for Rumble options to purchase a number of Rumble Class B Common Shares.
The following summarizes the pro forma number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding following the consummation of the Business Combination and the PIPE Investment:

____________(1)      Sponsor Related Parties consist of the Sponsor and officers and employees of Cantor and its affiliates (and family members of such persons), and Other Holders of Founder Shares consist of two of the independent directors of CF VI. Includes 1,159,000 PIPE Shares being issued and sold to the Sponsor, 1,567,500 PIPE Shares being issued and sold to officers and employees of Cantor and its affiliates (and family members of such persons), and the Founder Shares held by the two CF VI independent directors that own Founder Shares.
(2)      Includes 1,963,750 shares of Class A Common Stock held by the Sponsor that will be subject to forfeiture and cancellation based on the earnout in the Sponsor Support Agreement. Until these shares of Class A Common Stock held by the Sponsor are cancelled, Sponsor will have full ownership rights including the right to vote and receive dividends and distributions.
(3)      Includes a one-time grant of 1,100,000 restricted shares of Class A Common Stock, or restricted stock awards, that will be issued to Chris Pavlovski upon the closing of the Business Combination, which will vest in substantially equal annual installments for three years following the closing of the Business Combination, subject to Mr. Pavlovski’s continued employment through each vesting date. During the period of vesting of the restricted stock awards, Mr. Pavlovski will have all the rights of a stockholder as to the restricted shares of Class A Common Stock, including the right to vote such shares. Effective closing of the Business Combination, these restricted shares were exchanged to restricted share units with similar vesting conditions. As such, the table excludes these restricted share units, as these are not deemed vested and issued as of the date of the closing of the Business Combination.
(4)      Includes 76,412,604 Forfeiture Escrow Shares held by the former Rumble Shareholders that will, upon achievement of certain earnout milestones, be earned by such shareholders. Until these Forfeiture Escrow Shares are forfeited, the holders are deemed to be beneficial owner of these shares with the right to vote and receive any dividends, distributions and other earnings.
(5)      Excludes any shares issuable upon the exercise of any Exchanged Rumble Options.
(6)      Excludes 1,159,000 PIPE Shares being issued and sold to the Sponsor and 1,567,500 PIPE Shares being issued and sold to officers and employees of Cantor and its affiliates (and family members of such persons), which such shares are reflected in the “Sponsor Related Parties and Other Holders of Founder Shares” row above.

Anticipated Accounting Treatment
The Business Combination will be accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in conformity with GAAP. Under this method of accounting, CF VI will be treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. This determination was primarily based on holders of Rumble Shares expecting to comprise a majority of the voting power of the Combined Entity, Rumble’s operations prior to the acquisition comprising the only ongoing operations of the Combined Entity, and Rumble’s senior management comprising a majority of the senior management of the Combined Entity. Following the Business Combination, the Combined Entity will be governed by the Combined Entity Board consisting of six members, all of which will be designated by Rumble prior to the closing of the Business Combination (three of which must be independent directors). Under this method of accounting, the ongoing financial statements of the Combined Entity will reflect the net assets of Rumble and CF VI at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recognized.
CF VI and Rumble are currently evaluating the accounting treatment related to the CF VI Warrants upon the close of the Business Combination. Therefore, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, all CF VI Warrants have continued to be classified as derivative liability instruments. However, the evaluation and finalization of accounting conclusions regarding the classification are ongoing and subject to change.
The Locals Acquisition is treated as a business combination for accounting purposes and is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Rumble recorded the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Locals in its historical balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.
Basis of Pro Forma Presentation
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information contained herein reflects that CF VI Stockholders approved the Business Combination. Certain CF VI Stockholders elected to redeem their shares of Class A Common Stock for cash even if they approve the Business Combination. As a result, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements presents actual redemptions by CF VI Stockholders of 30,689 shares of CF VI Class A Common Stock for an aggregate payment of $307,197 (based on the per share redemption price of $10.01 per share) from the Trust Account. As such, net cash received from the Trust Account is approximately $300,039,065. This net cash amount is calculated as the difference of the total amount in the Trust Account as of June 30, 2022, of $300,346,262, minus the redemption amount of $307,197.
Rumble is considered the accounting acquirer, as further discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been presented for illustrative purposes only and do not necessarily reflect what the Combined Entity’s financial condition or results of operations would have been had the acquisition occurred on the dates indicated. Further, the pro forma condensed combined financial information also may not be useful in predicting the future financial condition and results of operations of the Combined Entity. The actual financial position and results of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein due to a variety of factors.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Note 1 â€” Basis of Presentation
